# DishtroyApp

An insanely addictive explosion game! See various food and people you don't like explode!

# Technologies we used:

Swift, UIKit, AVFoundation, AVKit, CoreAnimation, CoreMotion

# API:

N/A

# Objectvies and Difficulties:

* We initially have great ambitious ideas for the hackthon but have decided to work on something more managable as both of us are novice Swift developers
* We focused a lot of making extremely simple; concentrating on the gameplay and overall experience of Dishtroy
* We also put our attention to making a polish game
* We have trouble learning about CoreAnimation and was only able to implement basic animation into the game

# What's next for Dishtroy:

* Add animations to the fruits so that the user can see them disintegrate as they shake the phone
* Implement ReplyKit for instant reply and sharing
* Publish to the App Store
